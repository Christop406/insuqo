# INSUQO (Archive - Please Read!)

> Updated May 18th, 2023

Hello, viewer! This repository holds the code I created when working with one of my friends out of college on a product idea we had that was called INSUQO.

The idea of the project was to create an easy way for customers to buy life insurance (similar to [PolicyGenius](https://www.policygenius.com/)). I was (obviously) unable to complete the project because I began working at [Vidaloop](https://www.vidaloop.com/) in summer of 2019, and as operations ramped up there I didn't have enough time to finish (my friend did not help with programming).

## Notes

- This project **does not** fully represent my current skillset related to React. I have worked extensively with other SPA frameworks (Angular 2+) and feel that that experience translates into the fundamentals that create good React developers.
- This project was began a long time ago, but I'd say at this point I had around a year of React experience with projects on-and-off.
- API keys found within this repo have been revoked and/or restricted and will not work. This repository was private before it was public.
